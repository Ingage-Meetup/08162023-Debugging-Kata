# Debugging Kata

In the Solutions folder you'll find source code files written in five different languages: C#, Java, Javascript, Python, and Typescript.

The code in each file implements a simple book inventory program. Each program contains a number of errors.

Your assignment is:

1. Choose a language

2. Copy the files written in that language into a starter project.

3. Get the program running.

4. Debug the program, finding as many bugs as you can. Fix the bugs as you encounter them.

5. Keep track of the bugs you find. The simplest way is to put a comment on the line before the bug.



# C3ProjectTemplate

See solutions in different languages in the "Templates" directory. Once you decide which language you'd like to use,
simply open that directory in your favorite IDE, and you should be able to run the included unit tests "out of the box".

The recommended IDEs are as follows, but feel free to use whatever IDE you are comfortable with.
